When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to colaborate with others, or when you wish to have cloud access to your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If colaborating with others you don't want the state of your files to change while engaged with them, and not all 
    changes pushed to the remote are necessarily complete. It is more efficient to update your local repository in one
    batch when you choose.
