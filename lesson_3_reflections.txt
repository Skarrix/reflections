When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to colaborate with others, or when you wish to have cloud access to your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If colaborating with others you don't want the state of your files to change while engaged with them, and not all 
    changes pushed to the remote are necessarily complete. It is more efficient to update your local repository in one
    batch when you choose.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork to create a copy of another repository on GitHub for my own use, a clone to create a copy of a repository on
    my local system, a branch when I want to experiment with changes or add extra features to an existing project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you are as up to date as possible

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Keeping track of changes would be very difficult  without Git, and sharing those changes and collaborating very 
    difficult without Github. Not much would be easier unless the project was exceedingly simple, saving you time
    without the need to commit, push, pull or merge changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
